SonicTest
======

This is a sample iOS application that uses the libsonic library and is similar
to the Android application available in sonic-ndk.

You first ned to install [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). Then
download the Sonic dependency, set up the XCode project and open it with:

      pod install
      open xcworkspace

Finally use XCode to build an test the iOS application normally.
